GridSearchCV is a very popular and powerful technique to tune your hyper-parameter and get a best result from your model.
Using Scikit-learn GridSearchCV is an efficient way but we will try to implement our own GridSearchCV from python.
The full explanation of the code is published on my Medium: https://noor12401.medium.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-with-custom-gridsearchcv-d5212f218cc0
